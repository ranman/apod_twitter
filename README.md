apod_twitter
============
You can see this in action here: [http://apodtwitter.com/](http://apodtwitter.com/)

You can deploy this to elastic beanstalk and just throw on the variables: `TWITTER_SECRET` and `TWITTER_CLIENT` then deploy the lambda functions.

This is not easy to setup on your own sorry. Eventually I'll make all of this better but for now I just want to share the code.
